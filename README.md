# Day-2-of-Java-Problem-Solving
In the day 2 I learn about the basic of java and made the program of some problems based on type casting , iterative statements , patterns printing.

Problems i have solved are following:-

1. Type Casting 
o Create a program to demonstrate implicit and explicit type casting 
between int, double, and float. 
2. If-Else Statement 
o Take an integer input from the user and check: 
▪ If the number is positive, negative, or zero.

3. Loop & Pattern Printing 
o Print the following pattern using a loop: 
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 

4. Pattern Matching (String Matching) 
o Take two strings as input from the user. 
o Check if the second string is a substring of the first string. 
o Print "Match Found" or "No Match". 

5. Nested Loops - Advanced Pattern Printing 
• Print the following number pattern: 
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4
